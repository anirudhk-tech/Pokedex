## The Trainer's Oath 🎮

By participating in this project, you agree to:

```
I promise to be respectful to all trainers,
Whether they code in Python or JavaScript,
Whether they're beginners or experts,
I will help, not hinder.

I will report bugs, not people.
I will build features, not barriers.
I will create documentation, not drama.

I will remember that behind every GitHub handle
Is a person, just like me,
Trying to catch 'em all... those bugs, that is!

This is my Trainer's Oath.
```
